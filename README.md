Inspired by [this](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/17/programming-a-bot-to-play-the-sushi-go-round-flash-game/) great tutorial.

### Usage:

If you want to try the bot yourself first make sure you have Python installed.
Then create a new folder on your **C:** disk, name it **PenguinDinerBot** (or whatever you want), clone the repo to that folder, open console (type`cmd` in Windows Search and press Enter).
When copy the lines below:


`cd C:\PenguinDinerBot

python bot.py`


Click the `index.html` file, allow the Flash plugin to work and if you see the start game window, press Enter on your console.
